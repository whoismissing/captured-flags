Attached is some some never-before-seen assembly code routine that we pulled off a processor which is responsible for string decryption. An input string is put into TRX register, then the routine is run, which decrypts the string.

For example, when putting 'iC"K\x0b\x03lyR.]gL!\x14' string in TRX and executing this code, the resulting string in TRX is decrypted as 'tenable.ctfd.io'.

A few things we know about this assembly:

There are only two registers, DRX and TRX. These are used to hold variables throughout the runtime.

Operand order is similar to the AT&T syntax ,which has destination operand first and source operand 2nd ie: MOV DRX, "dogs", puts the string "dogs" into DRX register/variable. XOR TRX, DRX, xors the string held in DRX with the string in TRX and stores the result in TRX register/variable.

There are only three instructions that this processor supports:

XOR - XORs the destination string against a source string and stores the result in the destination string operand. The source string operand can be either literal string or string held in a register/variable. Destination operand is always register. XORs all characters against target string characters starting with lower chars.
MOV - Simply copies the string from a source operand to the destination operand, the source string operand can be either literal or in another register as a variable.
REVERSE - This only takes one operand, and simply reverses the string. ie: if DRX holds "hotdog" then "REVERSE DRX" turns DRX into "godtoh". The operand for this can only be a register.
What we need We need an emulator that can execute the code in the attached file in order to decrypt this string...

If you successfully develop an emulator for this assembly and initialize TRX with this string, execution should yield a final result in the TRX register
