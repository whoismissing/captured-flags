Gonna have to get crafty with this one.

nc chal.tuctf.com 30504

Two buffers huh. Can you use both?

heap addr leaked = buffer 1
0x5655900c 17 bytes size

stack addr leaked = buffer 2
0xffffd2ac 16 bytes sizes

step 3 takes in 4 bytes to overwrite eip

TUCTF{4nd_4_0n3,_4nd_4_7w0,_4nd_5h3ll_f0r_y0u!}
