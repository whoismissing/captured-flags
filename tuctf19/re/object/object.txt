We've recovered this file but can't make much of it.
Do you see a procedural way to recover the password?

0000000000000000 <passlen>:
   0:   2c 00                   sub    $0x0,%al
   passlen = 0x2c = 44

.o file is the input to the linker

So we need to link it to get an runnable executable
gcc run.o -O0 -fPIC -W -ggdb -ldl
